I am a first-year computer science major at CSUF and I plan on graduating in 2028. I love learning about computer science, and all of its applications in our world.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 3, Part 2 (datediff.cc)
I liked this lab because it was fun to learn how to add arguments and parameters to function calls, and how to send return values back to the main function. It is also interesting to know the exact days between two particular dates. I also enjoyed using the program to find out how many days I have been alive for, among other examples.

Lab 8, Part 2 (pattern.cc)
I enjoyed this lab because I liked practicing 2D vectors and nested for loops. These concepts tested my knowledge and understanding of previous topics, and were satisfying to get correct. It was also nice to see the finished pattern appear in the terminal, and know that we created it.

Lab 7 (parking.cc)
This was my favorite lab this semester because I thoroughly enjoyed working with the conditionals to check every value, from street names to times of day. I also enjoyed working with multiple command line arguments, and it was also fun testing many combinations. Also, this lab shows one of many applications that computer science has, and how it can be used in everyday life.
